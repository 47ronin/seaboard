Not everyone knows how to work with data in the most effective and efficient way possible.  That's ok!  We're big nerds and we love our tools, so we decided to put together a page to get you going in the right direction.

Just a warning here - we're going to keep it simple and to the point.  There is always more than one way to do a thing.  We want to give just a little boost to beginners, and this what this page is for.

### Working with geospatial data.
We're a city, so a lot of the data you are seeing us publish is geospatial data.  Geospatial data is different than most other kinds of data because it's inherently multidimentional.  

We have used Carto to build complex applications like [StreetsSD](http://streets.sandiego.gov) and [simple visualizations that you see on the portal](data.sandiego.gov).  It's our tool of choice for quick geospatial work, and we think it's perfect for beginners.  

If you're not digging the web interface, or don't want to make yet another account somehwere else, check out [QGis](http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/).  It's an open source desktop software that lets you work with geospatial data.  ESRI also provides a [Geo Data Explorer](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/).

### Working with tabular data.
Tabular data on our portal comes in CSV form.  Most people who have Excel on their computers will use that to open up CSV files.   If you're not an Excel user, Google Docs or [LibreOffice Calc](http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) will do the trick.  

For larger CSVs, you can use [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) to manipulate and clean the data.  

### Finding Additional Data.
The portal doesn't yet have everything we want to publish.  We're working on it (check out the [Data Inventory Dataset](/datasets/data-inventory/) for our schedule).  

But even then -- we don't own all the data in the country, or even the region.  If you're on the hunt for complimentary data, check out the list below.  If we're missing some, we'd love a pull request from you with an addition!

### Finding Unpublished City Data.
Hey -- here's a little secret a lot of people don't know.  The California Public Records Act gives you, the citizen, the right to request government records.  And the City of San Diego has gone out of the way to make the process easy and smooth.  The [San Diego Open Public Records Portal](http://sandiego.nextrequest.com/) lets you search previous requests and responses to them, as well as make a brand new request.
