# JKAN [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timwis/jkan.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/timwis/jkan)
A lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll

Open-source data portals can be [really](https://twitter.com/waldojaquith/status/282599673569619969).
[hard](https://twitter.com/chris_whong/status/669207423719235584). to install and maintain. But their
basic purpose of providing links to download data really isn't that complicated. JKAN is a proof-of-concept
that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by simply
[clicking the fork button](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

## Installation
Just click "Fork" at the top-right of this page.

You can change the name and description of your site by changing the name and tagline of your forked repo.

## Usage
Using the [built-in edit button](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) on github,
add datasets to the [`_datasets`](_datasets) directory and organizations to the 
[`_organizations`](_organizations) directory.
