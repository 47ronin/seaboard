TRF also gathered overlays of various city boundaries from OpenDataPhilly and other local sources. More information on sources is available at http://www.policymap.com/files/ChildcareMapDataDirectory.pdf.\r\n\r\nData Purpose:  TRF collected the data to provide as clear a picture as possible of the supply of and demand for childcare in the city, and to better understand where the gaps are so that stakeholders can work to address them.\r\nIntended Audience:  Childcare providers, investors, policy makers, and parents.\r\nWhy Collected:  High-quality childcare supports positive child development and prepares children for success in school and beyond.  As such, accessing high-quality care is important for the well-being of neighborhoods and families.  By identifying areas where shortages of high-quality childcare exist, policymakers and investors can work towards increasing access for all.",

Nor is there a single source of data that indicates the demand for childcare services. And where demand data exist, it is inadequate because there is no clear indication of which children are in child care and which are not; which are in child care near where their parents live or near where they work. Because of this, TRF statistically estimated both the supply of and demand for child care by combining data from several different databases to best approximate both sides of the supply/demand equation.\r\n\r\nThe shortage in child care was measured generally in two ways: absolute and relative. The absolute shortage is the raw difference between supply and demand. The relative shortage is a measure that makes statistical adjustments for existing shortages in the market.\r\n\r\nAbsolute and relative shortages were subdivided to offer specific gap measures for total supply, certified supply and high-quality supply (defined as centers with a Keystone STARS 3- or 4-star rating). Every census block group in the city of Philadelphia has multiple supply, demand and shortage measures. Each of the shortage measures is instructive of the nature of the required programmatic or investment activity (e.g., invest in getting existing uncertified supply certified, upgrading existing certified supply, creating new high-quality supply).\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed description of the data and methodology, please see TRF’s forthcoming childcare report.\r\n\r\nCensus: Decennial Census and American Community Survey\r\nFor a detailed description of the census sources used in this mapping tool, including the difference between the decennial census and the American Community Survey as well as how percent change calculations are done between various years, please see the census entry in PolicyMap’s Data Directory."

A news item is a piece of data that has an ID, a title, a URL, a location (both human-readable and longitude/latitude), a schema, and a publication date associated with it.  Each news item may also have schema-specific attributes (key-value pairs).  Each metro area that EveryBlock serves has a different list of available schemas.\r\n\r\nAll endpoints are hosted on https://api.everyblock.com and require authentication. Authentication is handled with an API token in the HTTP request headers. \r\n\r\nThis is a REST-ful API that supports JSON, JSONP, and XML responses. Format types can be specified via an Accept header or extension within the URL. Querystring parameters can be \"metro\", \"location\", \"date\", \"attribute\", \"start_date\", \"end_date\". Additional details are available with the documentation.\r\n\r\nThere are API endpoints for events, schemas, location, location timeline, and popular news.",

  "notes": "Healthy Chinese Takeout participants as of 2/5/15. The Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.

Owners also agree to implement marketing materials (banners, stickers, signs) in their stores encouraging customers to make healthy choices. Stores making these required changes receive a $100 incentive each year.  Currently, toolkits are being developed for store owners to assist them in marketing and selling healthier foods.  \r\n\r\nStoreowners also receive at least one individualized training session on healthy food procurement and marketing. All stores automatically become members of the Philadelphia Healthy Corner Store Network and are eligible for the next level of engagement. \r\n\r\nEnhanced Healthy Corner Store: \r\n\r\nHealthy corner stores that meet specific criteria receive one-on-one training and assistance to introduce cost-efficient changes in their stores to increase their capacity to sell healthy foods.  In addition to specialized training, these stores also receive infrastructural changes, which include shelving and refrigeration to display and store fresh produce; inexpensive outdoor sidewalk stands for fresh produce and increased shelf space to stock bottled water and healthy snacks.

  "title": "Homes Saved",
  "notes": "To prevent homeowners from becoming homeless due to foreclosure, the City initiated the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Program, an innovative program that links a Court of Common Pleas order requiring that homeowners facing foreclosure have an opportunity to meet with their lenders to negotiate an alternative to foreclosure with City-funded housing counseling, outreach, a hotline and legal assistance. Working together, the City and the Court have created and implemented a national model.\r\n\r\n-\tSaveYourHomePhilly Hotline - To help keep Philadelphians in their homes, the City supports a hotline that enables homeowners to seek assistance as soon as they begin to have mortgage problems. At the SaveYourHomePhilly hotline (215-334-HOME), trained operators evaluate callers’ needs and make appointments with housing counselors or make other referrals. Since the hotline began focusing on foreclosure prevention (its previous focus was on anti-predatory lending), the City has promoted it with inserts into utility bills, public service announcements, and through the outreach efforts outlined below. Philadelphia Legal Assistance manages and staffs the SaveYourHomePhilly hotline.\r\n\r\n-\tForeclosure Prevention Outreach - A roadblock to saving the homes of households facing foreclosure is the paralysis many homeowners feel upon receiving a foreclosure notice. To combat that inertia the City funds proactive outreach to provide information on the services available to homeowners as early in the process as possible. Utilizing its network of Neighborhood Advisory Committees and select citywide organizations, the City supports door-to-door outreach to educate homeowners about their rights in the foreclosure process, the availability of housing counseling and legal support, and the SaveYourHomePhilly hotline through which homeowners can begin to access these services.\r\n\r\n-\tHousing Counseling - A key element of the success of the Foreclosure Prevention Program is that every homeowner is matched with an OHCD-funded housing counselor. These counselors are knowledgeable about available sources of mortgage support, have experience negotiating with lenders, and have worked with homeowners in and out of foreclosure on issues such as budgeting, credit repair and meeting the responsibilities of owning a home. For those homeowners who are able to save their homes – more than 40 percent of program participants to date – they emerge from the process not only still in their homes but also more prepared to avoid future financial problems.\r\n\r\n-\tCommunity Legal Services - Although the housing counselors in the Foreclosure Prevention Program are skilled in negotiating with lenders and their attorneys, there are instances in which homeowners facing foreclosure require legal support to resolve their cases. To that end, OHCD funds Community Legal Services (CLS) to provide mortgage foreclosure legal services to homeowners facing foreclosure. CLS attorney/paralegal teams help homeowners responding to foreclosure lawsuits to negotiate with lenders to modify mortgage loan terms to preserve homeownership, or will represent the homeowner to defend foreclosure, as appropriate.",

  "notes": "Founded as William Penn's \"Holy Experiment,\" Philadelphia has a centuries-long history of fostering and constructing prominent houses of worship throughout the city. In recent decades, as congregations face declining membership and shifting neighborhood demographics, these historically- and architecturally-significant properties have often suffered from deferred maintenance, insensitive alterations, and partial or complete demolition.\r\n\r\nAdvocacy organizations like the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and Partners for Sacred Places have focused on this issue for years, highlighting the threats to Philadelphia's neighborhoods and communities if these structures continue to be abandoned or lost. Over the summer of 2011, in order to more fully understand and address the issue, the Preservation Alliance partnered with Philadelphia Historical Commission and Partners for Sacred Places to develop a comprehensive index of historic churches covering the entire city. Compiling, verifying, and updating data from a number of different sources, University of Pennsylvania graduate student Molly Lester assembled a database which includes every purpose-built house of worship constructed in the city before 1960.\r\n\r\nData elements include:  current congregation, original congregation, address, year of construction, original architect and whether or not the build is on the Philadelphia or National Historic Registers.\r\n",

Analysis tools include tables, summary statistics, charts, trend lines, and neighborhood reports. Developed by the University of Pennsylvania's Cartographic Modeling Lab (CML), the application is designed to support broad urban policy analysis and evaluation of Philadelphia neighborhoods. Data is drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau and other agencies, including the Department of Licenses and Inspections, the Philadelphia Mayor's Office, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, and the city's utilities agencies.

To help identify and celebrate these emerging landmarks, the Preservation Alliance is compiling a list of notable structures built within the city between 1945 and 1980. The inclusion of a building in this inventory does not imply endorsement of it for designation or other purposes, nor does its absence imply a lack of significance. Rather, the list is meant to illustrate the breadth and depth of design from an era often overshadowed by earlier periods and styles.",

  "notes": "SEPTA SMS Transit enables users to request scheduled trip information via text message. Users subscribe to the service via text. After setting up an account, users can receive schedule information by texting the Stop ID number for a bus, trolley, or subway stop to 41411. They will receive a return text with information on the four next scheduled trips from that stop. Users can include the specific route designation in the text to receive information on a certain route if the stop serves multiple routes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn addition to using the SMS, there is also a simulator which people can use to experiment at no cost.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFinally, the SMS data can be accessed from an API.  The data returned by the API is currently text format, \\n separated.  SEPTA expects to add JSON and XML versions later.  The API can be accessed in the format:  \r\nhttp://www3.septa.org/sms/var1/var2/var3/\r\n <br><br>\r\n[var1] = stop id\r\n<br>\r\n[var2] = route id  OR  i/o for inbound/outbound\r\n<br>\r\n[var3] = i/o for inbound/outbound only if route id is supplied\r\n <br><br>\r\nStops fall into one of three categories, here's an explanation with some sample links:\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ol style=\"list-style: decimal inside none;\">\r\n<li>\r\nStops with service provided by only one route, stop is not the first or last stop and\r\nall travel is in a single direction:\r\n<br><br>\r\nhttp://www3.septa.org/sms/321\r\n<br>\r\nReturns the next 4 scheduled trolleys (All Route 13) at Chester Ave & 49th St.\r\n<br><br>\r\n</li><li>\r\nStops with service provided by multiple routes, but all travel is in one direction:\r\n<br><br>\r\nhttp://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/\r\n<br>\r\nReturns the next 4 scheduled trolleys at 22nd St. Station. Note the results shows\r\ntrolleys regardless or route.  To grep just a single route, for a multi-route, uni-directional\r\nstop, add another var:\r\n<br><br>\r\nhttp://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/13/\r\n<br>\r\nReturns only the Route 13 trolleys at 22nd St. Station\r\n<br><br>\r\n</li><li>\r\nStops with travel in multi-directions.  This is usually end points, like the trolley\r\nloop at Juniper and they may or may not have multiple routes.

Once emergency status is declared, the City's 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW for its location. Do NOT call 911.\r\nThe snow-emergency-routes.csv file was created from the table on the Streets Department snow emergency route page. I used this file to generate the snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file.\r\n\r\nThe snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file contains the IDs of all of the street segments that are classified as snow emergency routes.
